## 5. Problem
- Fans face unfair resale prices (avg. 3–4× face value).

- Charities receive nothing from billions lost to scalpers.

---

## 6. Solution

- Redirect surplus to charities chosen by artists.
- Take a small fee to sustain the platform.
- Fans receive tax receipts (where applicable) and status as contributors to social causes.
